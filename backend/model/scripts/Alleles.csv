strong TB partial relaxation, and fail to open anterior isthmus most of 
the times.  Adults don't seem to have the TB phene but often the 
ant-is does not open following corpus opening.
So, I guess n2226 is probably a dominant-negative allele.

splice donor site of the sixth exon, which affects the splicing of the
alternative seventh exons.  RT-PCR revealed the presence of intron 6
between exon 6 and exon 7a. Because a stop codon is present in the sixth
intron, the resulting mutant protein would be truncated in the eighth
transmembrane domain. The other band with a size similar to that of wild
type corresponds to a mixture of alternate transcripts using cryptic donor
sites. Because this allele is a hypomorph, not a null, some of these
transcripts must be translated into a near full-length product that would
differ from the wild type only in the relatively poorly conserved region

notes below by Meghan Jobson via email communication with Ewa Bednarek 10/17/2006 
made for JLB (used unc-5 promotor instead of unc-47 because it was to be used in unc-30 background where unc-47 does not express). unc-5 promotor is from JLB and the RIM construct is via JL from Nonet lab. the RIM construct (pEB72) has the CA2 domain and PDZ domain because reportedly the PDZ domain is not sufficient to  localize. 

injection info though to be at 5 ng (unc-5::RIM-PDZ-GFP), 5 ng (lin-15), 90 ng/100 (DNA ladder) as filler. this could be incorrect, check with Dr. Bednarek's notebooks if more detail is required. 
 
in adults the unc-5 is only expressed in the reinnervatingGABA cells so that is why you do not see the puncta in neurons.

I first linearized pSS1.6 with BsiWI which cut a big chunk out of the vector (see gel unc31-114).  The BsiWI cuts about 170 nucleotides upstream of the ATG of unc-31.  It also cuts again in the vector.  I isolated the upper band of unc31-114 which is going to contain the entire intron/exon structure of unc-31, with the GFP cloned into the 1st intron with splice acc/don sequences.  It also contains the poly-A signal.  This was co-injected with a digested PCR fragment that was generated with the primers unc-31 KpnI/unc-31 7kb reverse.  This segment of DNA includes ~6.5kb of upstream promoter region from the ATG and goes into the beginning of the second exon.  This PCR product was digested with NheI (unc31-115) in order to cut off the 3’ end.  This was done because this will be co-injected w/ pSS1.6 which has overlapping sequences, but also has GFP cloned into the same NheI site.  I did not want to get a recombination during array formation between the linearized pSS1.6 and the PCR fragment that would eliminate the GFP.

     First let me say that this was quite a bit of hacking till this DNA was ready for injection.  First off, I needed to linearize the pSS1.7 construct that contains the punc-31:GFP transcriptional, but only ~2 kb of upstream of promoter, which I found to not be sufficient with my rescue experiments using pSS1.5.  I first linearized pSS1.7 with BsiWI which cut a big chunk out of the vector.  The BsiWI cuts about 170 nucleotides upstream of the ATG of unc-31.  It also cuts again in the vector.  I gel-isolated the upper band .  This piece of DNA contains a NLS-GFP with a stop and the unc-54 3'UTR cloned into a NheI site in the first intron of unc-31. It also contains out to the poly-A signal.  This was co-injected with a digested PCR fragment that was generated with the primers unc-31 KpnI/unc-31 7kb reverse.  This segment of DNA includes ~6.5kb of upstream promoter region from the ATG and goes into the beginning of the second exon.  This PCR product was digested with NheI (unc31-115) in order to cut off the 3’ end.  This was done because this will be co-injected w/ pSS1.7 which has overlapping sequences, but also has GFP cloned into the a NheI site.  I did not want to get a recombination during array formation between the linearized pSS1.7 and the PCR fragment that would eliminate the GFP.

oxEx609,,,Sean Speese,pSS1.7 18a,"This is the strain that contians the punc-31:GFP transcriptional that was made by Sean Speese.  Note that this is the second punc-31: GFP transcriptional made and it is more elaborate and has broader expression than the first (EG3188, EG3203, and EG3204).

There are three separate lines of this transgenic and I have scaled the Intensity of expression and transmission frequency of the array below, using the isolation names I gave them.

Array Transmission (%)
pSS1.7 12a > pSS1.7 18a > pSS1.7 17a

The unc-26 cDNA, yk453b7 from Yuji Kohara, was used as template in order to create NotI sites on either side of the unc-26 sequence, u26NotI: GCGGCCGCTATGTCAGTTCGAGGGATTCGG and u26Not2: GCGGCCGCTCTACATATTTTTTGGTCTAGGTGG, and was cloned into the NotI site of the vector pPD95.67NotI.

""deletion size is about 920bp, reaching from the middle of the 2nd intron to about a third of the way through the fourth exon.  The deletion started directly after the sequence tctgcccagttcaaaat.  The deletion end point was a little unclear enough for some reason, that I failed to write it down.  Probably had some scrambled sequence that did not match.  Good match restarted with the sequence ttcatatggattcag.  I had noted several AG's downstream of the deletion that could act as in-frame splice acceptors with regard to the exon 2 donor.  By Western blot (using the Ab I already sent to you guys) the protein was present in normal abundance but was clearly smaller than WT.""

Also slightly Unc. In bar-1(ga80) hermaphrodites any of the six vulval precursor cells (P3.p-P8.p) can sometimes fuse with hyp7 without dividing, and P5.p-P7.p can adopt the tertiary cell fate instead of the primary or secondary fates. In addition, the neuroblast QL and its progeny migrate towards the anterior instead of the posterior, and the cell P12 usually adopts the fate of P11. bar-1(ga80) do mate, but poorly. bar-1 encodes a beta-catenin molecule and the ga80 mutation is predicted to cause an early truncation of the protein.

The promoter and the full-length coding sequences of the group I (Johnstone, [ 2000]) collagen genes ZK1193.1 (col-19), C39e9.9, and T01b7.7 (rol-6) were cloned in frame to the green fluorescent protein GFP-C3 (Crameri et al., [1996]) in a pSP65 backbone (Promega). The following primers were used to generate products with compatible restriction sites to the GFP expression vector: col-19, col19-A 5-cgcctgcagCATTTGAAAATTTGCACC-3 (PstI underlined) and col19-B 5-ggggtaccGCCTTGTAAGCTGCACG-3 (KpnI underlined); C39e9.9, C39e9.9-A 5-cgcgcatgcTTCAAATGCCTGGCTTCATCG-3 (SphI underlined) and C39e9.9-B 5-cgcggtaccAAGACAAGACGTGCCGAAC-3 (KpnI underlined); rol-6, T01b7.7-A 5-gcgctccagAACAGGTGAATCTGAACCTCC-3 (PstI underlined) and T01b7.7-B 5-cgcggtaccAATTGGAATTTGCGATGACG-3 (KpnI underlined). Amplified genomic products were digested and ligated into similarly cut vectors and transformed into XL10 competent cells. Miniprep DNA was either microinjected at 20 g/ml with pBluescript carrier DNA (100 g/ml) or in combination with 100 g/ml marker DNA pRF4 (rol-6 su1006). Transgenic lines were selected based on GFP expression for the col-19 construct or by the rolling phenotype of the coexpressed pRF4 marker for C39E9.9 and T01B7.7. Several lines expressing the COL-19::GFP extrachromosomal array were integrated into the genome after irradiation (38 Gy) from a 60Co source. A GFP-expressing strain TP12:kaIs12(col-19::gfp) was then selected and backcrossed 4× against wild-type nematodes to remove deleterious mutations.",,Co60 integration,[col-19::GFP]

during crosses, ceIs61 shows segregation behavior reminiscent of an extrachromosomal array. ceIs61/+ males give mostly red males and few red hermaphrodite progeny, as if the array were pairing with the X chromosome. (michael ailion 9/08)

ceIs61 appears to map to II because of failure to build the double mutant with unc-104(ox326) II. 0/35 Unc carried the array. (michael ailion 12/08)

Hi Jamie

I tested dye-filling and srbc-66gfp (only expressed in ASK) and found that almost 99% animals lost ASK.
And qrIs2 seems to be more healthy than qrIs1.

Subject: sra-9::caspase question

Hi  Kyuhyung,

Sorry to bug you again.  How do you  know ASK is gone in the
sra-9::caspase strain?  In other caspase strains I have used, not 100%
of the neurons were killed.  Does the sra-9::caspase strain have an
ASK::gfp to make sure ASK is gone?  I couldn't see one (I did see nice
intestine gfp).

","Danielle Hamill, Bowerman/ CGC",,"Previously called spd-4. 2/06: From Bruce Bowerman: The or195 mutation changes base 10,679 of the cosmid clone T21E12 from a C to a T. This corresponds to dhc-1 cDNA nucleotide 9599 (WS153) , which is the center nucleotide of codon 3200. This codon changes from Serine in N2 to Leucine in or195 (S3200L). Note: this is not the same mutation for or195ts that we reported in Hamill et al, 2002(Dev Cell 3, 673-684). The mutation reported in our paper is not present in this strain. We apologize for the confusion. The pairs dhc-11a,b amplify the mutated fragment in dhc-1(or195). The mutation is near the center of this fragment; a clean (gel purified) DNA prep helps get a good read of it. dhc-11b: 5' aacagacgcacgattgacct 3'. dhc-11a: 5' ctcaaatcaaggaaggagct 3'.

see #462 and #1400 for other unc-31 cDNAs

michael’s summary of the unc-31 cDNA situation:

the correct cDNA appears to be 20 exons and encode a protein of 1353 amino acids. there probably is an alternative spliced form lacking the short exon 3. it is not clear whether we have an error-free full-length cDNA. kim’s cDNA pKS15.1 (#443) is probably complete, but has 2 mutations near the 5’end. patrick’s cDNA (#1400) corrected these mutations but lost exon 3 in the process. there is no annotation as to what the tom martin cDNA (#462) is and whether it is full-length, though in the construction info it says missing 3’end. ken miller’s cDNA lacks the first 3 exons and starts a bit  into exon 4, encoding a 1260 aa protein that rescues pretty well, perhaps as well as the full-length. the current wormbase (2007-2008) prediction extends exon 1 by 129 bp, adding 43 more aa to the N-terminal. This is almost certainly wrong as the 1353 aa protein has an N-terminal conserved between other species. kim’s cDNA was probably used in the rescue construct in fig. 4D of speese et al. 2007.

notes from erik 5/24/07:
Notes from phone conversation with Sean about the cDNAs.

(1) Wormbase predictions.
2004 - A very wrong prediction.  there was a missing nucleotide in the cosmid, which made a bizarre prediction.  Ken caught the error and got it fixed.  But the 5' end of the prediction is missing the first 3 exons.
2005 - wormbase version had the corrected 3' at Ken Miller's suggestion but still lacked the correct 5' end.
2006 - Wormbase eventually got the 5' end right and added the three 5' exons.
2007 - Wormbase is currently incorrect in Sean's opinion. they just recently extended the N-terminus by 129nt = 43 aa - but there is no conservation of this sequence with the vertebrate clones.

(1) Ken Miller's cDNA.
Ken Miller used the 2004 wormbase prediction to make a cDNA.   Ken compared his product after this to worm base and saw that there was a missing nucleotide in the cosmid sequence, which forced genefinder to made a bizarre prediction.  Ken got it fixed.  But the 5' end of Ken's cDNA is missing the first 3 exons and the beginning of exon 4, comprising 93 aa.  This was because of the early bad call by wormbase which he used to make primers. Ken compared his predicted sequence to the rat cDNA, which is a short sequence compared to other species, so he was not alarmed.
2006 - Ken's cDNA under the rab-3 and unc-17b promoters rescues.  so these 93 aa cannot be so important.  (but do these constructs rescue all behaviors?)  Ken's cDNA matches matches ours starting at the 4th exon.

(2) Sean's rescuing construct.
Sean points out that the N-terminal domain (including the 93aa) is conserved in all CAPS proteins.  In particular this DDDEEE motif right at the start.  Sean's GFP construct is inserted in the intron between exons 1 + 2.  His construct has the whole gene with all of the introns.  The GFP product is made and rescues.  Does it rescue all the way?  When he picks the best moving worms they looked pretty good, defecation completely rescued.

(3) Kim's cDNA pKS15.1.
Kim thinks the cDNA came from Tom Martin when he was in Kouichi's lab.  The virtual sequence associated with the clone was mailed to Kim by Kouichi - the sequence file might possibly have been constructed by Liakot.
The virtual sequence that was associated with the construct was incorrect.
virtual sequence contained 3 extra tracks of nucleotides, two exons were extended, and 20 nucleotides in the middle of an intron was included. Sean said those 20 nucleotides were not associated with real splice junctions and thus it was likely to be a bogus sequence.
Sean sequenced Kim's cDNA and it matches the Kohara cDNA not the virtual sequence. It starts at an ATG in exon 1 that matches the conserved mammalian start.  Kim hooked it up to Paex-3, but as I remember it did not rescue well.  It is unlikely that the two aa changes had an effect since this region was not even contained in Ken Miller's rescuing constructs.

(4) Patrick's cDNA pPH1.
In Kim's cDNA there were also 2 nucleotide changes that changed amino acids at the 5' end, Patrick corrected these by making a chimeric cDNA. He RT-PCR'd 1500 bp from the 5' end to a unique restriction site (exons 1-?). The PCR product was sequenced and ligated it to the 3' fragment from kim's cDNA.   he made our heat-shock construct from this clone. patrick's heat shock construct exhibited weak rescue according to Patrick -- he was not happy with it.  Sean never saw it but 
suspected that the weak rescue was just due to its mosaic nature or incomplete rescue from heatshock.

michael’s addendum: patrick’s cDNA could not have been the one used to make the heat shock strain reported in fig. 4D of speese et al. that strain is oxIs79 and was made in 2002 by kim, presumably from her cDNA pKS15.1. patrick’s cDNA was made in 2005. there are no worm strains in our collection constructed by him with this cDNA. see sean’s addendum below: this cDNA may be missing exon 3.

(5) Matt Petrie's cDNA.
Seean only has the sequence (he doesn't have DNA). Sean will send the cDNA sequence but apparently it matches the current wormbase prediction and Kim's cDNA exon predictions.  They may in fact be the same DNA.

(6) Kaplan's cDNA.
QueeLim Ch'ng from Josh's lab said he saw alternative splicing in unc-31.

i have not  heard from Matt yet whether he saw evidence of alternative splicing.

message from tom martin 5/29/07 regarding the possibility of alternative splicing:

Hi Erik-



Matt forwarded me some of the correspondence on unc31 alternative
splicing forms.  Actually Kyoungsook Ann, previously in my lab now
back in Korea, did most of the unc31 sequencing (this goes back a
number of years).  For wt worms, she consistently obtained one
sequence for unc31 mRNA.  This was done by isolating polyA RNA and
generating PCR amplicons from four primer sets that covered the 4kb
ORF.  This led her to correct the unc31 cDNA sequence (at least
compared to Livingstone's and early wormbase entries).



I think that only one sequence was seen in wt worms.  For some of the
mutants, in contrast, multiple sequences were obtained.  Some of these
could be de-convoluted into a collection of sequences that indicated
deletions in the message- likely alternative splicing.  But my
recollection was that this only occurred in mutants rather than wild
type.  I would need to wade back into the notebooks to verify the
above but that is my impression.

michael’s addendum: in ann et al. 97, they show the sequence of an unc-31 cDNA (from livingstone evidently) that has 1360 amino acids. the differences between this and sean’s 1353 aa prediction are in the middle of the protein (concerning aa 415-446) and seem to arise by some sort of alternative splice of exon 8, but i can’t find canonical splice junctions in the region to get the sequence reported by ann, so i suspect that this sequence might be mistaken.

notes from sean 6/17/07 regarding the possibility of alternative splicing:

Unc-31 cDNA saga:  6-17-07

Erik,
  Here is my attempt to piece together the unc-31 cDNA story a little better.  I had to look through my notes for a while, align some old sequences, etc.  

Patrick’s RT-PCR to make a new cDNA:
 Patrick and I decided to make a new cDNA to fix two mistakes that I had found in the martin lab cDNA.  I am not so sure these were actually mistakes anymore, but rather problems in wormbase annotation. Patrick and I decided to use a piece of a Kohara cDNA clone (cannot find where I wrote down which one, might be in Patrick’s notebook) that we sequenced and found it to look good.  We missed about 250 bp due to where are primers were located but the coverage of the rest of the Kohara clone looked good.  We pieced together a RT product Patrick generated and the Kohara clone at a unique site to make the new cDNA.  It is important to note that this Kohara clone did not seem to show any differential splicing from Tom or Ken’s cDNA.  However I did find something strange in the RT-PCR product of Patrick’s that we sequenced.  Patrick’s RT-PCR clone is missing the third exon that Tom’s cDNA contains and wormbase predicts (Ken’s would also be missing this as his misses the first three exons that Tom’s cDNA has). It is a very small exon containing only 36 nucleotides (CCAATGAGAATGAATGCTCCATCACCAATGCCACAG) that code for the following: PMRMNAPSPMPQ.  This does not appear to be to well conserved in vertebrate CAPS, but it should be looked at closer.    

michael’s addendum (7/3/09): there is now an alternatively spliced cDNA lacking exon 3 on wormbase (ZK897.1b) supported by 
EST FM249156.

Martin unc-31 cDNA: 
	This cDNA has an ORF of 4062 nucleotides including the TAA and codes for a protein that is 1353 amino acids long. The cDNA that Ken miller gave me starts at 297 of the Martin cDNA and ends at the same place.  So Ken’s is missing the 5' end that we have, which codes for amino acids that are conserved, but clearly not needed based on the results from Ken’s paper (Charlie ’06). When I align his cDNA with 297 on of the Martin cDNA, they match exactly.  Makes me wonder why I thought there was errors in Tom’s cDNA if Tom and Ken have the same thing.  Might have been a mistake in wormbase.

michael’s summary of the unc-31 cDNA situation:

the correct cDNA appears to be 20 exons and encode a protein of 1353 amino acids. there is no solid evidence for alternative splicing. it is not clear we have this full cDNA. kim’s cDNA pKS15.1 (#443) is probably complete, but has 2 mutations near the 5’end. patrick’s cDNA (#1400) corrected these mutations but lost exon 3 in the process. there is no annotation as to what the tom martin cDNA (#462) is and whether it is full-length, though in the construction info it says missing 3’end. ken miller’s cDNA lacks the first 3 exons and starts a bit  into exon 4, encoding a 1260 aa protein that rescues pretty well, perhaps as well as the full-length. the current wormbase (2007-2008) prediction extends exon 1 by 129 bp, adding 43 more aa to the N-terminal. This is almost certainly wrong as the 1353 aa protein has an N-terminal conserved between other species. kim’s cDNA was probably used in the rescue construct in fig. 4D of speese et al. 2007.

notes from erik 5/24/07:
Notes from phone conversation with Sean about the cDNAs.

(1) Wormbase predictions.
2004 - A very wrong prediction.  there was a missing nucleotide in the cosmid, which made a bizarre prediction.  Ken caught the error and got it fixed.  But the 5' end of the prediction is missing the first 3 exons.
2005 - wormbase version had the corrected 3' at Ken Miller's suggestion but still lacked the correct 5' end.
2006 - Wormbase eventually got the 5' end right and added the three 5' exons.
2007 - Wormbase is currently incorrect in Sean's opinion. they just recently extended the N-terminus by 129nt = 43 aa - but there is no conservation of this sequence with the vertebrate clones.

(1) Ken Miller's cDNA.
Ken Miller used the 2004 wormbase prediction to make a cDNA.   Ken compared his product after this to worm base and saw that there was a missing nucleotide in the cosmid sequence, which forced genefinder to made a bizarre prediction.  Ken got it fixed.  But the 5' end of Ken's cDNA is missing the first 3 exons and the beginning of exon 4, comprising 93 aa.  This was because of the early bad call by wormbase which he used to make primers. Ken compared his predicted sequence to the rat cDNA, which is a short sequence compared to other species, so he was not alarmed.
2006 - Ken's cDNA under the rab-3 and unc-17b promoters rescues.  so these 93 aa cannot be so important.  (but do these constructs rescue all behaviors?)  Ken's cDNA matches matches ours starting at the 4th exon.

(2) Sean's rescuing construct.
Sean points out that the N-terminal domain (including the 93aa) is conserved in all CAPS proteins.  In particular this DDDEEE motif right at the start.  Sean's GFP construct is inserted in the intron between exons 1 + 2.  His construct has the whole gene with all of the introns.  The GFP product is made and rescues.  Does it rescue all the way?  When he picks the best moving worms they looked pretty good, defecation completely rescued.

(3) Kim's cDNA pKS15.1.
Kim thinks the cDNA came from Tom Martin when he was in Kouichi's lab.  The virtual sequence associated with the clone was mailed to Kim by Kouichi - the sequence file might possibly have been constructed by Liakot.
The virtual sequence that was associated with the construct was incorrect.
virtual sequence contained 3 extra tracks of nucleotides, two exons were extended, and 20 nucleotides in the middle of an intron was included. Sean said those 20 nucleotides were not associated with real splice junctions and thus it was likely to be a bogus sequence.
Sean sequenced Kim's cDNA and it matches the Kohara cDNA not the virtual sequence. It starts at an ATG in exon 1 that matches the conserved mammalian start.  Kim hooked it up to Paex-3, but as I remember it did not rescue well.  It is unlikely that the two aa changes had an effect since this region was not even contained in Ken Miller's rescuing constructs.

(4) Patrick's cDNA pPH1.
In Kim's cDNA there were also 2 nucleotide changes that changed amino acids at the 5' end, Patrick corrected these by making a chimeric cDNA. He RT-PCR'd 1500 bp from the 5' end to a unique restriction site (exons 1-?). The PCR product was sequenced and ligated it to the 3' fragment from kim's cDNA.   he made our heat-shock construct from this clone. patrick's heat shock construct exhibited weak rescue according to Patrick -- he was not happy with it.  Sean never saw it but 
suspected that the weak rescue was just due to its mosaic nature or incomplete rescue from heatshock.

michael’s addendum: patrick’s cDNA could not have been the one used to make the heat shock strain reported in fig. 4D of speese et al. that strain is oxIs79 and was made in 2002 by kim, presumably from her cDNA pKS15.1. patrick’s cDNA was made in 2005. there are no worm strains in our collection constructed by him with this cDNA. see sean’s addendum below: this cDNA may be missing exon 3.

(5) Matt Petrie's cDNA.
Seean only has the sequence (he doesn't have DNA). Sean will send the cDNA sequence but apparently it matches the current wormbase prediction and Kim's cDNA exon predictions.  They may in fact be the same DNA.

(6) Kaplan's cDNA.
QueeLim Ch'ng from Josh's lab said he saw alternative splicing in unc-31.

i have not  heard from Matt yet whether he saw evidence of alternative splicing.

message from tom martin 5/29/07 regarding the possibility of alternative splicing:

Hi Erik-



Matt forwarded me some of the correspondence on unc31 alternative
splicing forms.  Actually Kyoungsook Ann, previously in my lab now
back in Korea, did most of the unc31 sequencing (this goes back a
number of years).  For wt worms, she consistently obtained one
sequence for unc31 mRNA.  This was done by isolating polyA RNA and
generating PCR amplicons from four primer sets that covered the 4kb
ORF.  This led her to correct the unc31 cDNA sequence (at least
compared to Livingstone's and early wormbase entries).



I think that only one sequence was seen in wt worms.  For some of the
mutants, in contrast, multiple sequences were obtained.  Some of these
could be de-convoluted into a collection of sequences that indicated
deletions in the message- likely alternative splicing.  But my
recollection was that this only occurred in mutants rather than wild
type.  I would need to wade back into the notebooks to verify the
above but that is my impression.

michael’s addendum: in ann et al. 97, they show the sequence of an unc-31 cDNA (from livingstone evidently) that has 1360 amino acids. the differences between this and sean’s 1353 aa prediction are in the middle of the protein (concerning aa 415-446) and seem to arise by some sort of alternative splice of exon 8, but i can’t find canonical splice junctions in the region to get the sequence reported by ann, so i suspect that this sequence might be mistaken.

notes from sean 6/17/07 regarding the possibility of alternative splicing:

Unc-31 cDNA saga:  6-17-07

Erik,
  Here is my attempt to piece together the unc-31 cDNA story a little better.  I had to look through my notes for a while, align some old sequences, etc.  

Patrick’s RT-PCR to make a new cDNA:
 Patrick and I decided to make a new cDNA to fix two mistakes that I had found in the martin lab cDNA.  I am not so sure these were actually mistakes anymore, but rather problems in wormbase annotation. Patrick and I decided to use a piece of a Kohara cDNA clone (cannot find where I wrote down which one, might be in Patrick’s notebook) that we sequenced and found it to look good.  We missed about 250 bp due to where are primers were located but the coverage of the rest of the Kohara clone looked good.  We pieced together a RT product Patrick generated and the Kohara clone at a unique site to make the new cDNA.  It is important to note that this Kohara clone did not seem to show any differential splicing from Tom or Ken’s cDNA.  However I did find something strange in the RT-PCR product of Patrick’s that we sequenced.  Patrick’s RT-PCR clone is missing the third exon that Tom’s cDNA contains and wormbase predicts (Ken’s would also be missing this as his misses the first three exons that Tom’s cDNA has). It is a very small exon containing only 36 nucleotides (CCAATGAGAATGAATGCTCCATCACCAATGCCACAG) that code for the following: PMRMNAPSPMPQ.  This does not appear to be to well conserved in vertebrate CAPS, but it should be looked at closer.    


Martin unc-31 cDNA: 
	This cDNA has an ORF of 4062 nucleotides including the TAA and codes for a protein that is 1353 amino acids long. The cDNA that Ken miller gave me starts at 297 of the Martin cDNA and ends at the same place.  So Ken’s is missing the 5' end that we have, which codes for amino acids that are conserved, but clearly not needed based on the results from Ken’s paper (Charlie ’06). When I align his cDNA with 297 on of the Martin cDNA, they match exactly.  Makes me wonder why I thought there was errors in Tom’s cDNA if Tom and Ken have the same thing.  Might have been a mistake in wormbase.  ","unc-31 cDNA cloned into pGEM5ZF. Although it says it is full length, it does not contain the 3’ end."

Recessive mutations in sur-5 can be complemented by a plasmid, pTG1-1, that contains 9.8 kb of genomic DNA from the sur-5 locus (2.3 kb of which is upstream of the presumed initiation codon and 5 kb of which extends from the initiation codon to the termination codon; GU et al. 1998 Down). By means of the PCR technique (SAIKI et al. 1985 Down), pTG1-1 was modified such that the predicted stop codon and 3' untranslated DNA were precisely replaced with a SmaI restriction site that had been incorporated into the downstream primer. Digestion of this DNA with SmaI therefore generates an end that has a CCC triplet in place of the stop codon. This permitted a fusion of the 3'-end of the open reading frame of sur-5 with an exon encoding GFP in pPD95.70. This was achieved by ligating a 7.3-kb SphI/SmaI fragment (obtained from an intermediate plasmid containing sur-5 DNA) into the corresponding sites present in the multiple cloning region of pPD95.70."

The left end of this cosmid deletion was determined by sequencing using oDW35, located at position  11349 of W05H9 (GATCAGATAAAA).  In addition, sequencing indicated that the insert of BC10 was actually inserted in the sequence GGATCT (position 389 of pJB8), and not in the BamHI site as predicted. (dw 11 20 2001)
-According to Alan Coulson the vector of BC10 is not pJB8, but rather pHC79.  This explains why the insertion of the seqeunce is not in the BamHI site of pJB8.  The ends of this vector have been sequenced using oDW35 and oDW40.  The left end is (GATCAGATAAAA) and the right end is (ATTTTGATGATC).

These strains supply tRNA genes for AGG, AGA, AUA, CUA, CCC, GGA on a Col-E1 compatible chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid. Thus the Rosetta strains provide for ""universal"" translation which is otherwise limited by the codon usage of E. coli. Transcription of the tRNA genes isdriven by their native promoters.

WARNING: This was originally labeled “Ratiometric phluorin” but in fact contains the superecliptic version of phluorin.

Nov. 20, 2008:
I sent this plasmid to Kieth Nehrke at U of Rochester and he found a.) it fluoresces but does not produce ratiometric fluorescence (i.e. emission following 410nm excitation) b.) he sequenced the plasmid and found it actually contains superecliptic phluorin!

I am sequencing plasmid 1258 and this plasmid to test whether it is possible there was a mix up between these plasmids when they were frozen.

Dec. 1, 2008: I have sequence verified this plasmid. This construct contains the superecliptic version of phluorin with no artifical introns.

in a modified pET 28 vector also. There is no restriction site between BamH1 and start of GFP S11 M3, and the 6-cutter-s are in-frame with ATG of Nco-1 site.

I don't have the sequence of the entire plasmid at hand. But what we typically do, is clone our genes X Nde-1/Bamh-1 into the S11 vector, using primers with no stop codons,which places them in fusion X-GGGSGGGS-S11. There are no common restriction sites between the end of GFP S11 and the Nde-1 site, other than the Spe-1 and the Bamh1 cloning sites, which are in-frame with Nde-1.

see #443 and #462 for other unc-31 cDNAs

michael’s summary of the unc-31 cDNA situation:

the correct cDNA appears to be 20 exons and encode a protein of 1353 amino acids. there is no solid evidence for alternative splicing. it is not clear we have this full cDNA. kim’s cDNA pKS15.1 (#443) is probably complete, but has 2 mutations near the 5’end. patrick’s cDNA (#1400) corrected these mutations but lost exon 3 in the process. there is no annotation as to what the tom martin cDNA (#462) is and whether it is full-length, though in the construction info it says missing 3’end. ken miller’s cDNA lacks the first 3 exons and starts a bit  into exon 4, encoding a 1260 aa protein that rescues pretty well, perhaps as well as the full-length. the current wormbase (2007-2008) prediction extends exon 1 by 129 bp, adding 43 more aa to the N-terminal. This is almost certainly wrong as the 1353 aa protein has an N-terminal conserved between other species. kim’s cDNA was probably used in the rescue construct in fig. 4D of speese et al. 2007.

notes from erik 5/24/07:
Notes from phone conversation with Sean about the cDNAs.

(1) Wormbase predictions.
2004 - A very wrong prediction.  there was a missing nucleotide in the cosmid, which made a bizarre prediction.  Ken caught the error and got it fixed.  But the 5' end of the prediction is missing the first 3 exons.
2005 - wormbase version had the corrected 3' at Ken Miller's suggestion but still lacked the correct 5' end.
2006 - Wormbase eventually got the 5' end right and added the three 5' exons.
2007 - Wormbase is currently incorrect in Sean's opinion. they just recently extended the N-terminus by 129nt = 43 aa - but there is no conservation of this sequence with the vertebrate clones.

(1) Ken Miller's cDNA.
Ken Miller used the 2004 wormbase prediction to make a cDNA.   Ken compared his product after this to worm base and saw that there was a missing nucleotide in the cosmid sequence, which forced genefinder to made a bizarre prediction.  Ken got it fixed.  But the 5' end of Ken's cDNA is missing the first 3 exons and the beginning of exon 4, comprising 93 aa.  This was because of the early bad call by wormbase which he used to make primers. Ken compared his predicted sequence to the rat cDNA, which is a short sequence compared to other species, so he was not alarmed.
2006 - Ken's cDNA under the rab-3 and unc-17b promoters rescues.  so these 93 aa cannot be so important.  (but do these constructs rescue all behaviors?)  Ken's cDNA matches matches ours starting at the 4th exon.

(2) Sean's rescuing construct.
Sean points out that the N-terminal domain (including the 93aa) is conserved in all CAPS proteins.  In particular this DDDEEE motif right at the start.  Sean's GFP construct is inserted in the intron between exons 1 + 2.  His construct has the whole gene with all of the introns.  The GFP product is made and rescues.  Does it rescue all the way?  When he picks the best moving worms they looked pretty good, defecation completely rescued.

(3) Kim's cDNA pKS15.1.
Kim thinks the cDNA came from Tom Martin when he was in Kouichi's lab.  The virtual sequence associated with the clone was mailed to Kim by Kouichi - the sequence file might possibly have been constructed by Liakot.
The virtual sequence that was associated with the construct was incorrect.
virtual sequence contained 3 extra tracks of nucleotides, two exons were extended, and 20 nucleotides in the middle of an intron was included. Sean said those 20 nucleotides were not associated with real splice junctions and thus it was likely to be a bogus sequence.
Sean sequenced Kim's cDNA and it matches the Kohara cDNA not the virtual sequence. It starts at an ATG in exon 1 that matches the conserved mammalian start.  Kim hooked it up to Paex-3, but as I remember it did not rescue well.  It is unlikely that the two aa changes had an effect since this region was not even contained in Ken Miller's rescuing constructs.

(4) Patrick's cDNA pPH1.
In Kim's cDNA there were also 2 nucleotide changes that changed amino acids at the 5' end, Patrick corrected these by making a chimeric cDNA. He RT-PCR'd 1500 bp from the 5' end to a unique restriction site (exons 1-?). The PCR product was sequenced and ligated it to the 3' fragment from kim's cDNA.   he made our heat-shock construct from this clone. patrick's heat shock construct exhibited weak rescue according to Patrick -- he was not happy with it.  Sean never saw it but 
suspected that the weak rescue was just due to its mosaic nature or incomplete rescue from heatshock.

michael’s addendum: patrick’s cDNA could not have been the one used to make the heat shock strain reported in fig. 4D of speese et al. that strain is oxIs79 and was made in 2002 by kim, presumably from her cDNA pKS15.1. patrick’s cDNA was made in 2005. there are no worm strains in our collection constructed by him with this cDNA. see sean’s addendum below: this cDNA may be missing exon 3.

(5) Matt Petrie's cDNA.
Seean only has the sequence (he doesn't have DNA). Sean will send the cDNA sequence but apparently it matches the current wormbase prediction and Kim's cDNA exon predictions.  They may in fact be the same DNA.

(6) Kaplan's cDNA.
QueeLim Ch'ng from Josh's lab said he saw alternative splicing in unc-31.

i have not  heard from Matt yet whether he saw evidence of alternative splicing.

message from tom martin 5/29/07 regarding the possibility of alternative splicing:

Hi Erik-



Matt forwarded me some of the correspondence on unc31 alternative
splicing forms.  Actually Kyoungsook Ann, previously in my lab now
back in Korea, did most of the unc31 sequencing (this goes back a
number of years).  For wt worms, she consistently obtained one
sequence for unc31 mRNA.  This was done by isolating polyA RNA and
generating PCR amplicons from four primer sets that covered the 4kb
ORF.  This led her to correct the unc31 cDNA sequence (at least
compared to Livingstone's and early wormbase entries).



I think that only one sequence was seen in wt worms.  For some of the
mutants, in contrast, multiple sequences were obtained.  Some of these
could be de-convoluted into a collection of sequences that indicated
deletions in the message- likely alternative splicing.  But my
recollection was that this only occurred in mutants rather than wild
type.  I would need to wade back into the notebooks to verify the
above but that is my impression.

michael’s addendum: in ann et al. 97, they show the sequence of an unc-31 cDNA (from livingstone evidently) that has 1360 amino acids. the differences between this and sean’s 1353 aa prediction are in the middle of the protein (concerning aa 415-446) and seem to arise by some sort of alternative splice of exon 8, but i can’t find canonical splice junctions in the region to get the sequence reported by ann, so i suspect that this sequence might be mistaken.

notes from sean 6/17/07 regarding the possibility of alternative splicing:

Unc-31 cDNA saga:  6-17-07

Erik,
  Here is my attempt to piece together the unc-31 cDNA story a little better.  I had to look through my notes for a while, align some old sequences, etc.  

Patrick’s RT-PCR to make a new cDNA:
 Patrick and I decided to make a new cDNA to fix two mistakes that I had found in the martin lab cDNA.  I am not so sure these were actually mistakes anymore, but rather problems in wormbase annotation. Patrick and I decided to use a piece of a Kohara cDNA clone (cannot find where I wrote down which one, might be in Patrick’s notebook) that we sequenced and found it to look good.  We missed about 250 bp due to where are primers were located but the coverage of the rest of the Kohara clone looked good.  We pieced together a RT product Patrick generated and the Kohara clone at a unique site to make the new cDNA.  It is important to note that this Kohara clone did not seem to show any differential splicing from Tom or Ken’s cDNA.  However I did find something strange in the RT-PCR product of Patrick’s that we sequenced.  Patrick’s RT-PCR clone is missing the third exon that Tom’s cDNA contains and wormbase predicts (Ken’s would also be missing this as his misses the first three exons that Tom’s cDNA has). It is a very small exon containing only 36 nucleotides (CCAATGAGAATGAATGCTCCATCACCAATGCCACAG) that code for the following: PMRMNAPSPMPQ.  This does not appear to be to well conserved in vertebrate CAPS, but it should be looked at closer.    


Martin unc-31 cDNA: 
	This cDNA has an ORF of 4062 nucleotides including the TAA and codes for a protein that is 1353 amino acids long. The cDNA that Ken miller gave me starts at 297 of the Martin cDNA and ends at the same place.  So Ken’s is missing the 5' end that we have, which codes for amino acids that are conserved, but clearly not needed based on the results from Ken’s paper (Charlie ’06). When I align his cDNA with 297 on of the Martin cDNA, they match exactly.  Makes me wonder why I thought there was errors in Tom’s cDNA if Tom and Ken have the same thing.  Might have been a mistake in wormbase.  ",Patially sequenced. No mutations. 3’  Half of  cDNA from Kohara. 5’ half generated by rtPCR using phusion polymerase.

The TEV protease produced by this strain is the autoinactivation-resistant mutant S219P.

The tRNA accessory plasmid pRIL (Stratagene) [actually pACYC]
  	 
 Replicon: 	ColE1/pBR322 (pRK792)
p15A (pRIL)

Notes: 	The pRIL plasmid (Stratagene) improves the yield of TEV protease by increasing the supply of argU tRNA in the cell (for AGG and AGA codons). The catalytic activity of the S219P mutant is approximately 2-fold lower than that of the wild-type protease. Shifting the temperature from 37 °C to 30 °C during induction maximizes the yield of soluble TEV protease.

 Notes: 	The specificity of TVMV protease is distinct from that of TEV protease. The canonical recognition site for TVMV protease is ETVRFQS, with cleavage occurring between Q and S.

The OmniMAX™ 2 T1 Phage-Resistant (T1R ) E. coli strain is an improved chemically competent cell line, perfect for use in all cloning applications, including the Gateway® Technology. OmniMAX™ 2 -T1R cells offer the highest transformation efficiency of any chemically competent cells in a One Shot® format with >5 x 109 transformants/µg pUC19. They also provide efficient transformation of highly methylated DNA, since OmniMAX™ 2 -T1R cells lack the E. coli K12 restriction systems (mcrA (mrr hsdRMS-mcrBC)). In addition, the strain carries the tonA genotype, which confers resistance to T1 and T5 phage infection. This protects your samples and minimizes the possibility of downtime in your lab due to phage contamination. The highly versatile OmniMAX™ 2 -T1R strain offers the following benefits:


*	Ideal for transformation of Gateway® and TOPO® reactions

*	Resistance to T1 and T5 phage (tonA)

*	Construction of more representative genomic libraries due to the elimination of mcrA, mcrBC, mrr, and hsdRMS

*	Blue/white screening of recombinant clones (lacZM15)

Worm mCherry clone is from Karen Oegema via Jonny Fares. We have signed an MTA.  It is best if you
direct anyone who wants the clone to Karen Oegema.  She may agree to have us send the DNA out but the MTA needs to be dealt with via Oegema.

A 5.8 kb genomic DNA sequence containing hid-1 promoter and coding
sequence was PCR amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA and inserted
into the vector pPD95.75 (from the Fire lab vector kit) using SphI and
AgeI. The resulting construct contains about 900 bp upstream of hid-1
ATG and the hid-1 gene is followed in frame by gfp gene. This
construct was used in the HID-1 project.

A 10.16 kb genomic DNA sequence containing hid-1 longer upstream and
coding sequence was inserted into the vector pPD95.75 (meosfp instead
of gfp) using XmaI and AgeI. This construct did not work (no mEosFP

HI Erik,

I was a great pleasure to have you here. Your seminar is awesome and people are still talking about it.

They did not send me the vector sequence and I only have the GCaMP3 sequence as below. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any other help we can provide. Cheers!

Grows better than E148D, so I suspect it might be a spontaneous mutant."," I had to patch these from my own sequencing of these plasmids after I got them from John Collier.  Note that there are the following plasmids:

In addition to the DNA sequence changes that result in the indicated amino acid changes, all of these mutants have other changes in the wobble codon so that while the amino acid sequence of DT-A is not changed (except for the indicated amino acid change), the DNA sequence for the rest of the protein has some differences.  These wobble changes are the same in all the mutants but are different than  in the wild type.  pDT-A and pDT-A(E148K) are in pET15b plasmid.  The rest are in an obscure vector called pLM125 (a graduate student in the lab of John Collier had made it; nobody knows anything else about it).  All are Amp resistant
	The only other thing is that some of these plasmids have linkers and/or the signal peptide before the DT-A (catalytic fragment) which are not shown in the Strider sequence.  To make my constructs, I used PCR with the 5'primer designed to introduce a restriction site followed by methionine followed by the amino acid sequence GADDVVDSSK (which is in all these plasmids, but as I mentioned above, the DNA sequence might be different).  The 3' PCR primer was to the end of the DT-A sequence.  These PCR products were subcloned into my coelomocyte-expressing vector.  Both DT-A(K51E) and DT-A(E148D) worked in that the coelomocytes were ablated.  I could not get transformants from wild-type DT-A, presumably because my promoter is a bit leaky and the DT-A was killing essential cells (one molecule is enough to kill a mammalian cell).  The DT-A fragment is, of course, the catalytic fragment and has to be expressed inside the cells to kill them.  It cannot translocate into cells without the B fragment that is not expressed in worms."

http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi00489a021","From Hanna Fares <fares@email.arizona.edu>: 
I had to patch these from my own sequencing of these plasmids after I got them from John Collier.  Note that there are the following plasmids:

pDT-A, pDT-A(E148K), pDT-A(K51E), pDT-A(E148D), pDT-A(E148S), pDT-A(W50R), pDT-A(delE148)

In addition to the DNA sequence changes that result in the indicated amino acid changes, all of these mutants have other changes in the wobble codon so that while the amino acid sequence of DT-A is not changed (except for the indicated amino acid change), the DNA sequence for the rest of the protein has some differences.  These wobble changes are the same in all the mutants but are different than  in the wild type.  pDT-A and pDT-A(E148K) are in pET15b plasmid.  The rest are in an obscure vector called pLM125 (a graduate student in the lab of John Collier had made it; nobody knows anything else about it).  All are Amp resistant
	The only other thing is that some of these plasmids have linkers and/or the signal peptide before the DT-A (catalytic fragment) which are not shown in the Strider sequence.  To make my constructs, I used PCR with the 5'primer designed to introduce a restriction site followed by methionine followed by the amino acid sequence GADDVVDSSK (which is in all these plasmids, but as I mentioned above, the DNA sequence might be different).  The 3' PCR primer was to the end of the DT-A sequence.  These PCR products were subcloned into my coelomocyte-expressing vector.  Both DT-A(K51E) and DT-A(E148D) worked in that the coelomocytes were ablated.  I could not get transformants from wild-type DT-A, presumably because my promoter is a bit leaky and the DT-A was killing essential cells (one molecule is enough to kill a mammalian cell).  The DT-A fragment is, of course, the catalytic fragment and has to be expressed inside the cells to kill them.  It cannot translocate into cells without the B fragment that is not expressed in worms."

6104,Origami(DE3),bacteria only,01/03/2012,Joseph Smith (Gillian’s lab),Unknown,kan/tet,,,,"Origami™ host strains are K-12 derivatives that have mutations in both the thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase (gor) genes, which greatly enhance disulfide bond formation in the E. coli cytoplasm. Studies have shown that expression in Origami(DE3) yielded 10-fold more active protein than in another host even though overall expression levels were similar. The original Origami strains are compatible with ampicillin-resistant plasmids and are ideal for use with pET-32 vectors, since the thioredoxin fusion tag further enhances the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. The trxB and gor mutations are selectable on kanamycin and tetracycline, respectively; therefore, these strains cannot be used with plasmids that can only be selected with kanamycin or tetracycline. To reduce the possibility of disulfide bond formation between molecules, strains containing mutations in trxB and gor are recommended only for the expression of proteins that require disulfide bond formation for proper folding. 

DE3 indicates that the host is a lysogen of λDE3, and therefore carries a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the lacUV5 promoter.

Thus the Origami B strains combine the desirable characteristics of BL21, Tuner™, and Origami strains in one strain background. The mutations in trxB and gor are selectable on kanamycin and tetracycline, respectively; therefore, these strains cannot be used with plasmids that can only selected with kanamycin or tetracycline. These strains also include the lon and ompT deficiences of BL21, which increase protein stability.

The lac permease (lacY) mutation allows uniform entry of IPTG into all cells in the population, which produces a concentration-dependent, homogeneous level of induction. By adjusting the concentration of IPTG, expression can be regulated from very low levels up to the robust, fully induced levels commonly associated with pET vectors. Lower-level expression may enhance the solubility and activity of difficult target proteins.

mammalian expression vector for N-terminally tagging your protein of interest with HaloTag.  TEV protease site follows HaloTag.  Backbone is pcDNA5frt with Hygromycin resistance for single copy inserts in frt contaning cell lines.  Notes from Charles Banks:

Here is a vector NTi file for the N terminal Halo tag in pcDNA5/FRT. I usually clone by generating a pcr product with either a PmeI or an SgfI site at the 5’ end and a PmeI site at the 3’ end. The 5’ primer needs an extra nucleotide so that the tag is in frame with the protein coding region e.g.:

Pfu polymerase fused to Sumo for protein purification. Also fused to DNA binding domain Sso7d. Except for the sumo purification domain, this is the Phusion clone described in the patent for Phusion polymerase. See patents cited in Phusion documentation for the improvements. 

The DNA yield is very poor in minipreps. The plasmid has therefore not been fully sequenced. 

This protein is covered by commercial patents. Use the DNA clone accordingly - for research use but not for commercial use.
